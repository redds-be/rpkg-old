# rpkg

## ⚠️ **WARNING** ⚠️

This project is no longer maintained *but* will be rewritten in another language, and will probably be renamed to rpkgm (to clear any confusion with another tool and include "manager" in it).
I will add the link to the git repo of the new version when I start said project.

## Description

**R**edd's **p**ac**k**a**g**e manager, written in python.
This project has nothing to do with [rpkg](https://glaciermodding.org/rpkg/)
